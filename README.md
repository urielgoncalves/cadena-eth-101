Environment Setup
As a smart contract developer we need to compile, test, debug, and deploy our contracts. Then we need a front-end library to help us interact with our smart contract. There are many development frameworks and front-end libraries that help us with this, the most popular being truffle and web3.js.

While truffle and web3.js are used in many projects today, more and more developers are switching over to Hardhat and ethers.js for smart contract development so we will be using this stack moving forward. We still recommend playing around with truffle and web3.js. There are even SDKs out there that abstract away the complexity of developing contracts so you can write everything in just JavaScript, but it's important to learn the basics first.
